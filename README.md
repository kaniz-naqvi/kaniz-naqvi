# Hi there, I'm Mehak Naqvi
*Passionate Full Stack Developer in the Making*

I'm a Frontend Developer with strong React and Redux Toolkit expertise, currently building the frontend of **LeadLyft**, a UK-based SaaS platform. Alongside frontend development, I'm expanding into backend work as a Junior Backend Developer with Node.js and PostgreSQL.

My long-term goal is to grow into a Full Stack Developer and eventually specialize as an AI Engineer.

## What I Do

- **Frontend:** React, Redux Toolkit, JavaScript (ES6+), Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap  
- **Backend (In Practice):** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, REST APIs  
- **Problem Solving:** Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript  
- **Architecture:** Component-driven UI, state management, API integration  
- **Currently Exploring:** Material UI (MUI), scalable full stack project structure

## Current Focus

- Developing and maintaining the frontend of **LeadLyft (SaaS application)** using React and Redux Toolkit; integrating APIs and implementing production features  
- Exploring backend development as a **Junior Backend Developer** (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL)  
- Designing and building **EchoMe Portfolio Generator** (React, Express, PostgreSQL, Tailwind)
